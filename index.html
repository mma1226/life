  <button class="my-button" id="rect" onclick="alert('Uranine is a fluorescent organic compound that belongs to a class of compounds known as xanthenes. The chemical structure of Uranine is composed of three fused aromatic rings (a xanthene structure) with a carboxylic acid group (-COOH) and two sodium atoms (-Na) attached to it.The molecular formula of Uranine is C20H10Na2O5, which indicates that it contains 20 carbon atoms, 10 hydrogen atoms, 5 oxygen atoms, and 2 sodium atoms. The molecular weight of Uranine is 376.27 g/mol. The bright green fluorescence of Uranine arises from the presence of conjugated double bonds in its molecular structure. When exposed to light of a certain wavelength, the electrons in the double bonds become excited and jump to a higher energy level. When the electrons return to their original state, they emit light energy of a longer wavelength, giving rise to the characteristic green color. Uranine is highly soluble in water and is often sold as a sodium salt, which makes it easier to dissolve in water. The sodium atoms in Uranines chemical structure make it highly water-soluble and also help to stabilize its fluorescence propertiesOverall, Uranines chemical structure and fluorescent properties make it a useful tool in a variety of applications, including hydrology, environmental science, and medicine.')"></button>
